# [1] CONTEXT: Real-Time 1D Position Tracking Using Named Pipes in a Bluethoot LOW ENERGY Scenario with different cows.

## Project Description

This project implements a real-time data processing pipeline to track the 1D position of a cow equipped with a Bluetooth tag. The pipeline connects multiple components via **Linux named pipes (FIFOs)** and manages the flow of data from raw measurements to a filtered output.

The cow transmits Bluetooth packets through a tag; a fixed anchor receives these transmissions and computes their **Angle of Arrival (AoA)**. By knowing both the anchor's and tag's height, and after applying filtering to smooth the data, the system computes the 1D position of the cow in real time.

The workflow is composed by 5 phases:
1. Creates Linux named pipes, to facilitate communication between the 
components. 
2. Starts the Preprocessing with aoa_to_1d and median_filter.py processes, ensuring they read 
from and write to the correct pipes.
aoa_to_1d.c receives pipes from Python script (pipeline.py) that is the called by test_pipe.

aoa_to_1d: A C program that converts the angle to a 1D position.

median_filter.py: A Python script that filters the data using the median.

4. Reads input data from input.csv, writes it to the aoa_to_1d input pipe, and 
ensures the process is properly notified when input is finished. 
5. Reads the final filtered output from median_filter.py and writes it to an 
output CSV file (output.csv). 
6. Handles process cleanup and removes the named pipes after execution.


## Work planning to follow (not the runtime but the code writing before testing)

1. Creating named pipes (FIFO)  [Python]

Create 2 pipes: one for aoa_to_1d and one for median_filter.py.

2. Starting processes with Python
Compile and run aoa_to_1d. [C language with GCC using Ubuntu shell with WSL]

Start median_filter.py with its parameters.

3. Data flow management

Read data from input.csv.
Write it to the aoa_to_1d pipe.
Read the output of aoa_to_1d and pass it to the median_filter.py pipe.
Write the final result to output.csv.

4. Shutdown and cleanup

Shut down all files and processes.

Delete named pipes.

5. Test

Write a test plan with several cases to cover.
Implement at least one automated test.

timestamp,tag_id,angle,tag_height 1733062840000,4baf351178aa9b0e,-30,1.2


# [3] TEST PLAN 

__________
Test phase
__________

Write a test plan with various cases to cover.
Implement at least one automatic test: the one I choose is y(x) = x case then OUTPUT == EXPECTED ???

Test Plan for pipeline.py using test_pipe.py as CALLER

********************************************************************************************
1. Test Named Pipes Creation [Setup test]

TASK: Verify that all named pipes are created correctly before running the program.

Success Criteria: After pipeline.py is started, the files input_pipe.fifo, output_pipe_aoa.fifo
and output_pipe_filter.fifo must exist 3/3

********************************************************************************************

********************************************************************************************
2. Process Startup Test

TASK: Check that aoa_to_1d and median_filter.py are started correctly.

==> first run gcc -o aoa_to_1d aoa_to_1d.c -lm
like:
gcc -c script.c
gcc -o exe script.c

fix the "bug": I consulted the linux documentation

/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cca4wrEa.o: in function `main':
aoa_to_1d.c:(.text+0x202): undefined reference to `tan'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
********************************************************************************************

I have set the "Success Criterion" for both processes that must be active in the system after the execution of pipeline.py.
i.e. processes Pi and Pj are exactly aoa_to_1d.c and median_filter.py




__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
TC 1: Read and Write Tests on Named Pipes that gave me problems and therefore you should implement on files
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

TASK: Verify that data flows correctly between named pipes.

Success Criterion: Data written to input_pipe.fifo must be correctly read by aoa_to_1d, and
the results must be correctly transferred to median_filter.py.

TC 2: Data Processing Tests
_________________________________________

TASK: Verify that aoa_to_1d correctly calculates the position and that median_filter.py correctly applies the median filter.

In the Dataframe test I found: (example with df.head(5) )

TC 3: Final Output Generation Test
_________________________________________

TASK: Ensure that the output.csv file is generated correctly and contains valid data.

Success Criterion: The output.csv file should be populated with the filtered data
without any formatting errors. This test can be simply
automated using dataframes and then casting the dataframe to a
csv so there is no need to worry about it

_________________________________________
TC 4: Cleanup and Termination Test
_________________________________________

TASK: Ensure that, at the end of the execution, the processes are properly terminated and that the named pipes are deleted.

Success Criterion: After the execution of pipeline.py, the processes should terminate and the FIFO files should be removed or the files should be deleted.

Success Criterion: The system should ignore bad rows and continue processing without interruption.

_________________________________________
TC 6: Performance Testing
_________________________________________

TASK: Evaluate the processing time for a large dataset.

Success Criterion: The system should process and a large input file within a reasonable time without crashing
and a not well solution could be the chuncks-subdivision of the input.csv.

_________________________________________
TC 7: Concurrency Testing
_________________________________________

TASK: Check the behavior of the system under multiple simultaneous inputs.

Success Criterion: The system must continue to run without deadlocks or data loss.

_________________________________________
Example of Automated Test for CASE 3
_________________________________________

Test: Output Verification for a Test Case

Objective: Automate a test that verifies that the generated output matches the expected output for a known input.

Method:

1. Create an input_test.csv file with known data, and you have that.
2. Run pipeline.py with input_test.csv.
3. Compare the generated output.csv to a reference file that you can create, but don't have now.
4. Success Criteria: The generated output must be identical to the expected file because this proves that the system is working correctly.



# [4] How to Run the global system

### 1. Compilation

To compile the C component:

Run the bash script 
make
Alternatively, manually:
gcc -o aoa_to_1d aoa_to_1d.c -lm


### 2. Execute the Pipeline
Run the main Python orchestrator:

python3 pipeline.py

This creates the FIFO pipes, starts the sub-processes, streams input and output, and performs cleanup.


## How to Run the Testing for the Test Plan

A comprehensive test plan is provided in test_pipe.py, covering the following areas:

1. Creation of FIFO pipes

2. Launching of external processes

3. Data transmission between components (via files instead of FIFOs, where needed)

4. Correct processing of known input data

5. Validation of generated output

6. Cleanup of processes and FIFOs

7. Robustness to malformed or corrupted input

8. Performance under large datasets

9. Concurrency with simultaneous inputs

10. Automated test of one complete known case

Run All Tests

python3 test_pipe.py

Or run the full automation: bash

./run_all.sh

# [5] Assumptions
1. The system runs on Linux or WSL, with FIFO support.

2. CSV inputs are assumed to be mostly well-formed.

3. Processes properly handle EOF and pipe input.

4. Malformed lines are skipped without halting processing.

5. The pipeline is linear and sequential, but concurrency is tested in parallel scenarios.

# [6] Requirements: Technologies
Skills in Named Pipe both in C and Python
Python 3.7 or higher in PyCharm Community Edition
GCC (to compile the C source)
Linux or WSL environment
Setup of the WSL
SOLID Principles are not mandatory in this application


# Cleanup
Temporary files and named pipes are automatically removed by pipeline.py and run_all.sh.

# [8] APPENDIX: Linux pills

The typical C compiler in Linux system is gcc (GNU C Compiler).

Syntax to reach /mnt:
cd /mnt/c/Users/....../AAA_Tool_development_workspace/Routing  (in my case)

### [8.1] C language pills...

Syntax to build a binary executable
 $ gcc-o <exec_name> <source_code>.c

Syntax to produce object code
 $ gcc-c <source_code>.c
 the output file is named <source_code>.o

Syntax to both build a binary executable and run it:
$ gcc <source_code>.c -o exe_name && ./exe_name

Syntax to install gcc:
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential




### [8.2] Python language pills...

Syntax to install python:
$ sudo apt install python3-pip

Syntax to see it:
which python3
(you should see /usr/bin/python3)

Syntax to discover python version
$ python3 --version

Syntax to upgrade the pip, e.g. if  new release of pip is available: 23.2.1 -> 25.0.1
$ python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

Syntax to upgrade the library used in this project:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Syntax to install pandas:
$ sudo apt install python3-pandas

Syntax to check the pandas version:
python3 -c "import pandas; print(pandas.__version__)"

Syntax to verify process running:
ps aux | grep aoa_to_1d
ps aux | grep python3

You can see the list of all active processes in your machine using
 ps-el

Syntax to run python script on bash (shell):
$ python3 pipeline.py

Syntax to know the state of WSL (e.g. Docker) on Windows PowerShell:
> wsl -l -v


### [8.3] C language syntax pills - Particular case: aoa_to_1d.c  contains math.h (see below)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>


Including  library  functions into  a program
gcc-o <exec> <source>.c -L<dir> -l<name>

The -l options is used to tell the compiler that  some functions in the source code have their 
object code in the lib<name>.a
 
the library is not in a standard directory, the directory must be specified through the  -L <dir>
option.

Standard libraries are part of the Operating System, while other 
libraries are distributed with the compiler; libcis the default C library containing input and output functions 
such as printf, scanf, open, read, write, etc.

Indeed, at first glance the syntax:

gcc -o aoa_to_1d aoa_to_1d.c

should be sufficient to correctly compile the file aoa_to_1d.c. However, in this case, it is necessary to add the -lm flag to link the math library (libm), and here is why "  gcc -o aoa_to_1d aoa_to_1d.c -lm  " is correct and mandatory!



# [9] APPENDIX C language: PIPES

In C, you can operate on files only in terms of sequences
of bytes: stream
There are no high-level functions like in other languages ​​such as Python that mimics the write() and read() of C.
In the C code of the project we use pointers.

To read and write to files, a pointer to a derived type is used
FILE *fileptr; //pointer to the file

This procedure is identical whether you use a file or a pipe.


(1) Example of pipe: When a process opens a file, a non-negative integer is returned, 
called file descriptor.  I/O redirection allows writing a program where data are read from 
stdinand written on stdout
 During program execution it is possible to duplicate the file 
descriptor used to refer to an open file so that a standard file 
descriptor can also be used to refer to that file.
 By closing the files associated to the standard file descriptors 
0(stdin)
 1(stdout)
 2(stderr)
 and then calling dup, it is possible to use 0, 1, or 2 to access the file 
whose descriptor is passed to dup



----------------------------------------------------------
unnamed pipes: allow interprocess communication between 
processes in a parent-child relationship
----------------------------------------------------------


#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>//for open()
#include <string.h> //for sprintf() : the output is a string
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main(){
	int x;
	int fd_pipe[2];//one for reading and one for writing
	char str[100];
	
	pipe(fd_pipe);//creating of communication channel in the parent channel
	printf("Please type an integer number: ");
	scanf("%d",&x);

	switch(fork()){
		case 0:
			//Parent's fd inheritance
			close(fd_pipe[0]);//because it has to write
			sprintf(str,"[CHILD] The new number is %d\n",x+5);
			write(fd_pipe[1],str,strlen(str));
			
			return 0;
		default:
			close(fd_pipe[1]);//because it has to read
			read(fd_pipe[0],str,sizeof(str));//I dont need to loop
			printf("[PARENT] The Child says: %s\n",str);
	}
}


## Half duplex
Parent		    ___________________________________________________       Child
  fd[1]--->read ---------------------------------------------------fd[1]--->write

(2) Another example of pipe: my script oao_to_1d.c



----------------------------------------------------------
named pipes: allow interprocess communication between any pair 
of unrelated processes (aoa_to_1d.c <--> median_filter.py)
----------------------------------------------------------


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

#define MAX_LINE_LENGTH 256

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 4) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <input_pipe> <output_pipe> <h_anchor>\n", argv[0]);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    const char *input_pipe = argv[1];
    const char *output_pipe = argv[2];
    double h_anchor = atof(argv[3]);

    FILE *input_fp = fopen(input_pipe, "r");
    if (!input_fp) {
        perror("Error opening input pipe");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    FILE *output_fp = fopen(output_pipe, "w");
    if (!output_fp) {
        perror("Error opening output pipe");
        fclose(input_fp);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    char line[MAX_LINE_LENGTH];
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), input_fp)) {
        unsigned long long timestamp;
        char tag_id[17];
        double angle, h_tag, x;
        
        if (sscanf(line, "%llu,%16[^,],%lf,%lf", &timestamp, tag_id, &angle, &h_tag) != 4) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error parsing line: %s", line);
            continue;
        }

        double alpha_rad = angle * M_PI / 180.0;
        x = (h_anchor - h_tag) * tan(alpha_rad);

        fprintf(output_fp, "%llu,%s,%.2f\n", timestamp, tag_id, x);
        fflush(output_fp);
    }

    fclose(input_fp);
    fclose(output_fp);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}


In C you can operate on files only in terms of sequences
of bytes: stream
There are no high-level functions like in other languages ​​such as Python that mimics the write() and read() of C.
In the C code of the project we use pointers.

To read and write to files we use a pointer to a derived type
FILE *fileptr; //pointer to the file

This procedure is identical whether you use a file or a pipe.

==> Script 2: aoa_to_1d.c <==
--Features: It uses named pipes (FIFO), i.e. special files in the filesystem.

The program takes the names of the pipes as command line arguments.

It communicates between separate processes (not necessarily parent-child) via FIFO files created before running the script.

--How it works:

FILE *input_fp = fopen(input_pipe, "r");
FILE *output_fp = fopen(output_pipe, "w");
These pipes must already exist, for example created with:

mkfifo pipe_input
mkfifo pipe_output


The process reads from one pipe (input_pipe) and writes the processing to another (output_pipe).

There is no fork() in the code → the processes involved are launched separately but communicate with each other via these special files.

==> Key concept:
Persistent inter-process communication, based on FIFO files in the filesystem.

==> Script 1: pipe.c <==
--Features:
Uses unnamed pipes, i.e. anonymous pipes created with pipe(fd_pipe).

It works internally between a parent process and its child process created with fork().

It is all autonomous, no files in the filesystem.

--How it works:

pipe(fd_pipe);
fork();

Child writes to pipe (fd_pipe[1])

Father reads from pipe (fd_pipe[0])

Data (integer plus 5) is passed directly into shared memory via pipe.

--Key concept:
Parent-child communication based on anonymous pipes in RAM. It is temporary and limited to the lifetime of the process.

## Differences summary:
Feature                        aoa_to_1d.c   (2)            pipe.c  (1)
Pipe type                      Named pipe (FIFO)             Unnamed pipe (anonymous pipe)
Communication                  between separate processes    Parent process ↔ child (fork)
Pipe creation                  Externally with mkfifo        Internally with pipe()
I/O mechanism                  fopen(), fprintf(), fgets()   read(), write()

Persistence Can persist in filesystem, Temporary, exists only in RAM
